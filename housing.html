	    <h2><b>Background & Objective </b> </h2>

        <p>My university uses a manual housing selection process. Students need to physically show up
            at a room during their assigned time, wait in line, and make their housing selection.
            The current process is time-consuming, and induce students' stress.
            The goal for this project is to understand the housing selection procedure;
            design and implement a solution to increase the efficiency of this procedure within 10 weeks.</p>

        <p>Some of the questions that guided me through the process:<br>
            -Who are the users? <br>
            -How can I reduce users stress? <br>
          -How will users use this system? <br>
          -Will users use this system?
        </p>
	 
	<p>Objective: <br>
            Create a housing selection system within 10 weeks that is usable. 
        </p>

	    <h2><b>Exploring Users and the Space/ Exploratory Research</b></h2>
	    
        <h4>Domain Research: Literature Review & Competitor Analysis</h4>

        <p>I looked into 3 other universities' housing selection process. Following is part of the comparison result. </p>

        <h3>Interview and Focus Group</h3>

        <p> In order to quickly and efficiently understand and empathize with multiple users for this project, 
		I chose to do informal interviews with 2 administrator and a focus group with 3 students.
            I asked about their past experience when going through the manual housing selection process.
        </p>

	    <h2><b>Synthesis of Exploratory Research</b></h2>
	    
        <p>I determined on three main use cases for the initial version of the system based on previous research. 
		Those are the use cases that are most essential for users to complete their final goal. <br>
            The three use cases are:<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Choose roommates<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Check available rooms<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Select Housing
        </p>
	    
	<h3>Persona</h3>
	    <p>Based on the information that I gathered, I created a persona. </p>

	   <p> <i>What I would do differently:<br>
		   I would collect more user data when creating the persona. I would also make the persona more visually appealing.</i> </p>

        <h3>User Flow/ Task Sequence</h3>
        <p>This is the high level architecture of what pages there will be and the flow of the system. </p>

	    <h2><b>Validate Initial Design </b></h2>
	    <p> To validate the application design, I used heuristic evaluation to evaluate the page, and conducted usability 
		    testing on the low fidelity paper prototype.
	    </p>
        <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>

        <p>I did heuristic evaluation on the paper prototype. <br>
        Below is an example of how I changed my design.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">

            </article>
        </div>

        <h3>Paper Prototype Usability Testing</h3>

        <p>I did 2 rounds of usability testing with 5 individual participants using think aloud technique. 
		During the study, I encouraged users to think-aloud. 
		Users were asked to complete 3 tasks based on the three initial use cases: choose roommates, 
		check available rooms, select housing.
            Below is a deliverable:</p>

        <div class="row">
            <article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
                <a href="images/Housing%20web%20application/User%20Testing%20Result.jpg" class="image fit thumb">
                    <img src="images/Housing%20web%20application/User%20Testing%20Result.jpg" alt="" /></a>
            </article>
        </div>
	    
	    <p> <i>What I would do differently:<br> 
		    During the usability testing session, I often caught myself probing the questions.
		    I would be more neutral about the questions that I will ask.  
		    I would also quantify the results more when I synthesis the data.</i> </p>

        <h4>Example Changes</h4>

        <p>This is an example of how I changed my design based on user feedback. <br> <br> When doing the testing,
            users had a hard time understand the functionality of the buttons below. I changed the design
            to make the buttons more informational.</p>

        </div>
<!-- 
        <p> In addition, most of the test participants mentioned that they would
          love to use this application if it's available. They mentioned that it
           will make their life a lot easier. </p> -->

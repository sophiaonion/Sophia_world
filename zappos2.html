            <h2>Zappos New Feature Idea 2: Fit Recommendation</h2>
        </header>
    </section>

    <!-- Have a section describe what exactly the idea is  -->
    <section id="one">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>This is a new feature idea I have for Zappos. Below is the steps
          I took to get to this idea, the feature itself, and a potential way
          to implement it.</p>
   </section>

    <section id="two">
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>Population & Technique: <br>
          I interviewed some online shoppers and zappos users. </p>
        <p>Question type: <br>Their previous shopping experiences. <br>
          How they make a judgement in terms of which item might fit them. </p>
        <p>Insights: <br> Some users choose sizes by comparing the item they want to
          purchase with their previous shopping experience of the same brand.
          However, this measurement is not always accurate since different model
          may be sized differently even within the same brand.</p>

   <section id="three">
       <h2>Zappos Feature Inventory</h2>
       <p> I inventoried Zappos' current features so that the new feature
         could be build upon the exisitng system. </p>

    <section id="four">
      <h2>The Idea</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the steps above, I create the following idea. </p>
        <p>
            We'll see how this feature works through a Zappos user Taylor.
            On a tuesday afternoon, Taylor decides to go onto Zappos and shop
            for a new pair of shoes because he loves Zappos and browsing on
            Zappos is one of his leisure activities. Besides, he wants to add
            a new pair of black converse to his shoe collection so that his new
            converse collection could include the full color spectrum. When he
            looks at this item, a pair of black converse, Zappos suggests that
            size 8 might be the best fit for him
       </p>

           <a href="images/new_feature_idea/zappos2/product_page.jpg" class="image fit thumb">
               <img src="images/new_feature_idea/zappos2/product_page.jpg" alt="" /></a>
       </article>

       <p>
         The fit recommendation feature makes this suggestion and it's based on
         Taylor’s previous shopping history. This recommendation feature
         predicts Taylor’s size range by looking at the measurements of previous
         shoes purchased. Taylor can make this sizing model more accurate by
         rating how his previously ordered items (including returned items) fit
         him. This model would adjust itself based on additional feedback from
         Taylor. Moreover, Taylor can select which items to be included in his
         sizing model. If Taylor has never purchased an item at Zappos before,
         he could give this recommendation feature some data by finding and
         rating several products that he already owns. Now Taylor has some good
         suggestions and he feels more confident with the size of the converse
         that he is going to buy.

         <h2>The Idea</h2>
       <p>How this could be realized: <br>
         This feature is a combination of Zappos' current Fit Survey and
       order history feature. First, Zappos would need to associate user’s
       fit survey result with this feature. When calculating the sizing model,
       Zappos would use the order history feature to get a list of previously
       purchased item. What needs to create is a database of the shoe size information.
       This information probably could be found via Zappos’ brand contacts.
       Moreover, to enable this feature, we need to develop an algorithm that
       could calculate and identify size ranges based on the items purchased.
       This algorithm should able to identify relevant information and could
       categorize itself.  There should not be too much change with the UI
       besides adding some additional components and requesting users to fill
       out a fit survey for every item they buy and every item they return.</p>
